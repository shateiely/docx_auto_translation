# Docx File Auto Translation

####Basics

This *Mathematica* program use Google Translate to translate text.

It takes in a .docx file and output a .docx file, where translated texts are append after the original text.

A sample .docx file: `test.docx` is in the folder and the corresponding output is `test_out.docx`, One can see that all text are translated, including normal text, text in graphics and grids, texts in footnotes and endnotes. but all formats are kept intact, this is really convenient, isn't it!
